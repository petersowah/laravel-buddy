A small stand-alone CLI app, built with [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/), that helps you to quickly setup your next laravel project.

## Documentation

composer global require petersowah/laravel-buddy
```

### Usage
To use the tool, please run:
```
buddy init [new-laravel-project]
```
and follow prompts. Database credentials are saved and you won't have to enter or set them ever again. eg. If you choose to use `mysql` connection for your database, the credentials are stored and the next time you choose same connection, they are auto-populated in your `.env` file. Cool!
